# PulsePal — U.S. Cardiovascular Health Atlas

An interactive **3D atlas** of U.S. county- and state-level cardiovascular health.
Every county is shaded on a **pink → red** ramp (redder = higher prevalence) on a
map you can **tilt and rotate** for a perspective view, so geographic patterns — the
Southeastern "Stroke Belt", Appalachia — and their change over time pop out at a glance.

Metrics (age-adjusted prevalence, adults ≥18):

- **High Blood Pressure** (hypertension)
- **Coronary Heart Disease**
- **Stroke**

> Inspired by the [Climate Vulnerability Index map](https://map.climatevulnerabilityindex.org/).

## Features

- 🗺️ **Tilted-perspective choropleth** (deck.gl) — flat pink→red polygons on a map plane you can pan, tilt & rotate.
- ⏱️ **Time slider** with play/animate across years.
- 🔀 **Compare two years side by side** with a camera-synced split view.
- 🏛️ **County ↔ State** mode toggle.
- 🔎 **Fuzzy search** for any ZIP code, county, or state — autozooms to it.
- 🛈 **Hover** any area for its exact value.
- 📈 **Compare 2–3 areas** by clicking the map; trend line graphs render below.
- 📱 Responsive, plus **/privacy** and **/support** pages for app-store submission.

## Data

Health measures come from **[CDC PLACES](https://www.cdc.gov/places/)** — model-based,
small-area estimates derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS), **age-adjusted**. County & state geometry comes from the **U.S. Census
Bureau** (via the [`us-atlas`](https://github.com/topojson/us-atlas) package).

### ⚠️ The committed dataset is a realistic PLACEHOLDER

`data.cdc.gov` is not reachable from every build sandbox, so the repo ships with
a **synthetic** dataset generated in the **exact CDC PLACES schema**. The
geography is realistic (Stroke Belt / Appalachia run high; Mountain West / Upper
Midwest run low) but **the numbers are generated, not measured — do not cite them.**
The app shows a **DEMO DATA** badge while this is in effect.

### Swapping in real CDC data (no code changes)

1. Allow `data.cdc.gov` in your environment's network egress settings.
2. (Optional) set release dataset ids / token in `.env` (see `.env.example`).
3. Run:

   ```bash
   npm run data:scrape
   ```

This rewrites `public/data/**` and `public/geo/**` with real values and flips the
`isPlaceholder` flag off — the frontend reads everything from `meta.json`, so no
component changes are required.

Regenerate the placeholder any time with `npm run data:placeholder`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run data:placeholder   # generate data + geometry + search index (already committed)
npm run dev                # http://localhost:5173
```

Build / preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Tech stack

React + TypeScript + Vite · **deck.gl** (tilted/rotatable flat choropleth, self-contained
WebGL — no basemap tiles needed) · **Fuse.js** (fuzzy search) · **Recharts** (trend lines) ·
**Zustand** (state) · **d3-scale/-interpolate** (color ramp).

## Deployment

Static SPA. `vercel.json` rewrites non-asset routes to `index.html` so deep links
(`/privacy`, `/support`) work. Any static host works with an equivalent SPA fallback.

## Support & privacy

In-app **/support** and **/privacy** pages are included for iOS App Store review.

For information and education only — **not medical advice**, and the shipped demo
numbers are synthetic. Figures describe geographic areas, never individuals.
